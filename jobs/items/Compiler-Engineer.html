<h1>Compiler Engineer</h1>
<p>published at 29.05.2018 10:20</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Edinburgh</p>
<p><strong>Company:</strong> Codeplay Software Ltd</p>
<p>Targeting recent artificial intelligence and machine learning applications to specialised heterogeneous platforms presents exciting new compiler-related challenges, ranging from optimizing low-level compiler backends for brand-new processors, to implementing support for complex portable programming models (such as C++ and SYCL). We are looking for enthusiastic compiler engineers to help us address those challenges!</p>
<p>This position requires solid understanding of modern compilers like LLVM or GCC, and how they process complex high-level source code into highly optimised machine code whilst maintaining correctness and compilation speed. Many of the targeted systems or technologies at Codeplay are not yet publicly announced and therefore require confidentiality, so this is an opportunity to work with brand-new hardware and software before anyone else does! The position is permanent and will be based at our offices in central Edinburgh. Salary Range (dependent on experience): &pound;27,000 to &pound;55,000.</p>
<h3>What We Offer</h3>
<p>Codeplay is internationally recognized as being at the forefront of software development technology, and working with us offers unique opportunities and challenges to learn new technologies and to be involved in shaping the software industry. Codeplay's projects range from: creating tools and tool sets (optimizing compilers, debuggers, profilers, programming models &amp; APIs, test systems/suites, ...) for brand-new unannounced next-generation hardware; developing and optimizing current machine learning (<a href="https://www.khronos.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TensorFlow&trade;</a>) and computer vision applications; research and development into lowering the power consumption of mobile devices, and contributing to new programming models and software standards (e.g. C++, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SYCL&trade;</a>, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">OpenCL&trade;</a>, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Vulkan&reg;</a> and <a href="https://www.khronos.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SPIR&trade;-V</a>).</p>
<p>Codeplay is an active contributor in the community for the <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Clang</a>, <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">LLVM</a> and <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">LLDB</a>open-source compiler and debugger projects. Our engineers are also leading the effort to bring support for machine learning with TensorFlow to OpenCL-enabled devices, by adding support for SYCL (the C++ high-level programming model built on OpenCL) to the open-source codebase. We are building an ecosystem around the SYCL standard, including public projects for computer vision, linear algebra, and C++ parallel programming APIs - see <a href="https://github.com/codeplaysoftware" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://github.com/codeplaysoftware</a>. If you are excited about contributing to programming tools that will be used by developers worldwide, please get in touch!</p>
